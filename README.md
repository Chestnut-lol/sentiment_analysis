### The followings are from the course website:
* project1.py contains various useful functions and function templates that you will use to implement your learning algorithms.

* main.py is a script skeleton where these functions are called and you can run your experiments.

* utils.py contains utility functions that the staff has implemented for you.

* test.py is a script which runs tests on a few of the methods you will implement. Note that these tests are provided to help you debug your implementation and are not necessarily representative of the tests used for online grading. Feel free to add more test cases locally to further validate the correctness of your code before submitting to the online graders in the codeboxes.
